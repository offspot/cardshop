            <h2>Downloading and your hotspot</h2>
            <p>Torrent-based downloads are more resilient and will for instance restart where they stopped in case your connection breaks down. They will also ensure the downloaded file is not corrupt. We recommend using <a href="https://www.transmissionbt.com">Transmission</a>.</p>
            <p>Once the image has been downloaded, flash it onto a microSD card (we recommend <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry's Imager</a>, but any such tool will do).</p>
            <p>Insert the card into your Raspberry Pi, plug it in, and wait for approximately 6-8 minutes during the initial boot-up process until you see the network status display <em>Kiwix</em> (or <em>Wikipedia</em> if you purchased the Wikipedia image) appear in your wifi settings.</p>
            <p>Connect to it and a captive portal should appear after a few seconds. If not, then type <a href="http://goto.kiwix.hotspot">http://goto.kiwix.hotspot</a> in your favourite browser (make sure there is no "s" after http).</p>
            <p>If you encounter any issue, check out our <a href="https://kiwix.org/en/hotspot-checklist-and-troubleshooting/">troubleshooting checklist</a> before reaching out by responding to this email.</p>
            <p>Enjoy!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Once your download has started you can go back to <a href="{{ shop_url }}">kiwix.org</a>.</p>
